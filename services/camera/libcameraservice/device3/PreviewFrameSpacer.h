/***
 * Preview stream spacer for better frame spacing
 *
 * The ideal viewfinder user experience is that frames are presented to the
 * user in the same cadence as outputed by the camera sensor. However, the
 * processing latency between frames could vary, due to factors such
 * as CPU load, differences in request settings, etc. This frame processing
 * latency results in variation in presentation of frames to the user.
 *
 * The PreviewFrameSpacer improves the viewfinder user experience by:
 * - Cache the frame buffers if the intervals between queueBuffer is shorter
 *   than the camera readout intervals.
 * - Queue frame buffers in the same cadence as the camera readout time.
 * - Maintain at most 1 queue-able buffer. If the 2nd preview buffer becomes
 *   available, queue the oldest cached buffer to the buffer queue.

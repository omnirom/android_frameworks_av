// This class analyzes various timestamps related to video rendering to compute a set of metrics
// that attempt to capture the quality of the user experience during video playback.
//
// The following timestamps (in microseconds) are analyzed to compute these metrics:
//   * The content timestamp found in the content stream, indicating the position of each video
//     frame.
//   * The desired timestamp passed in by the app, indicating at what point in time in the future
//     the app would like the frame to be rendered.
//   * The actual timestamp passed in by the display subsystem, indicating the point in time at
//     which the frame was actually rendered.
//
// Core to the algorithms are deriving frame durations based on these timestamps and determining
// the result of each video frame in the content stream:
//   * skipped: the app didn't want to render the frame
//   * dropped: the display subsystem could not render the frame in time
//   * rendered: the display subsystem rendered the frame
